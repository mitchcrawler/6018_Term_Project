Programming Term Project
This program helps with analyzing the sales data from the Christmas Tree Farm that my family and I run.  Specifically, I wanted to have a means to track the quantity of trees sold each day, broken down by species and height.  I also wanted a means to calculate what we pay out in labor for our employees.
